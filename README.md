[**View Dashboard on Tableau Public**](https://public.tableau.com/views/PeopleAnalyticsDashboard_17350125258500/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  

## **Description**  
This project features a Tableau dashboard developed with dummy company data to provide insights into employee metrics, survey results, and department-level performance. The dataset includes information on employee demographics, engagement scores, attrition rates, and departmental headcounts. The dashboard is designed with interactive visualizations—such as pie charts, bar graphs, and KPIs—tailored for human resources and people analytics use cases.

## **Key Features**  

### **Visual Analysis of Metrics**  
- Attrition rates, engagement scores, and employee distribution are visualized through intuitive charts and graphs.  
- Tracks headcount growth over time to reveal hiring trends and workforce stability.  

### **Advanced Use of Visualization Techniques**  
- **Pie Charts & Bar Graphs:** Display the distribution of key metrics such as gender, department, and survey responses.  
- **Line Charts:** Highlight trends in employee growth and retention.  
- **KPIs:** Offer quick summaries of critical performance indicators.  

### **Dynamic Filters and Parameters**  
- **Parameters:** Allow users to toggle between metrics like headcount, attrition rates, and engagement scores for tailored analysis.  
- **Filters:** Enable data exploration by department, time period, or other dimensions.  

### **Custom Calculations and Metrics**  
- Calculated fields are used to compute attrition rates, survey sentiment breakdowns, and other insights.  
- Percentages and trend analyses provide deeper understanding of workforce metrics.

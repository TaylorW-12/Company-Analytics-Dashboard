Description:
This project contains a Tableau dashboard developed with dummy company data to showcase insights into the metrics of employees, survey results, and department-level performance. The dataset comprises employee demographic information, engagement scores, attrition rates, and departmental headcounts. The dashboard is developed to present interactive visualizations, including pie charts, bar graphs, KPIs, and other techniques for human resources and people analytics use cases.

Key Features:

Visual Analysis of Metrics:
The dashboard visualizes the attrition rates, engagement scores, and distribution of employees in an intuitive manner through the use of charts and graphs.
It tracks headcount growth over time, enabling the derivation of hiring trends and workforce stability.
Advanced Use of Visualization Techniques:
- Distribution of key metrics such as gender, department, and responses to surveys is represented with pie charts and bar graphs.
- Line charts follow employee growth and retention trends.
- KPIs provide at-a-glance summaries of critical performance indicators.
Dynamic Filters and Parameters:
Parameters enable the user to switch between metrics, such as headcount, attrition rates, and engagement scores, to view tailored analysis.
Filters allow for data exploration by department, time period, or other key dimensions.
Custom Calculations and Metrics:
Calculated fields are used to calculate attrition rates, survey sentiment breakdowns, and other insights.
Percentages and trend analysis are included to give a deeper understanding of the data.
Usage and Techniques:
This dashboard reflects best practices in data visualization by including:

Pie Charts: Visualizing the distribution of gender and departmental breakdowns.
Bar Charts: Comparing headcount and attrition rates across all departments.
Line Charts: Workforce growth trends over time are highlighted.
KPIs and Highlights: Quick summaries of critical metrics.
Interactive Features: Filters and parameter-driven metrics enable users to delve into data dynamically based on their needs.
Python code to generate the dummy data for the project is contained in the repository. A realistic dataset has been generated, including employee demographics, survey results, and attrition information, which simulates metrics tracked in a mid-size organization.

The projects present my skills in these areas:

- Data storytelling using Tableau
- Developing dynamic dashboards that track exploratory data analysis.
- Combining Python and Tableau for End-to-End Data Analysis and Presentation
Please feel free to go through the code and explore the dashboard in detail to understand the techniques used!
